# twitter-inflation-perception

## Objective

Last year was marked by rampant inflation, which keeps having a negative impact on the global economy as of today. Monitoring the evolution of inflation through precise measurement is thus a crucial matter for central banks and other institutions. 

Simply put, inflation rate is measured by comparing the current prices of a set of goods and services to previous prices. Inflation is generally calculated by statistical and economic institutions such as Insee and Banque de France. The latter also studies inflation perception through survey and social media analysis. Specifically, Banque de France has tried to gather insights on how people perceive and discuss inflation on social media, and to use this information to better understand their economic sentiments and expectations as in [[1]](#1). 

Inspired by this article, our project aims to measure inflation perception by analyzing Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging the vast amount of text data available on Twitter, the project hopes to provide indicators that may be valuable to understand inflation dynamics.
